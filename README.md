# What is this?????

## This is a demo idea of a monster Engine project!!

The best way I can put this is like this... I make a game... you make a game... someone makes a game BUT

you need to be able to spawn a monster or enemy country. You can code all of that, sure OR you can build a spreadsheet, 
Tell this to read it and have it write out a dictionary in Python which will later be used to create Maps of "Monster Structs", which will have the name, the HP, and everything else you need.

So you make a spreadsheet with all your ideas, you point the program at your spreadsheet, you add rules, you launch the "server" and it will feed you a random monster struct into your game... this is still VERY early in development but I plan to get it ready to go over the next few weeks because It is going to be a part of another game I have been working on in Godot and I am hoping it will allow people to add their own items to it.

Anyway, Enjoy!
